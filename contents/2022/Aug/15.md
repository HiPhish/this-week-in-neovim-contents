### nvim-ts-rainbow

![A screenshot of some JSX code with `nvim-ts-rainbow` enabled. JSX tag names
are highlighted but their props are left
intact.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/183246789-1f322e79-aca2-499b-979e-2ff81feeefc6.png)

`nvim-ts-rainbow` gained improved support for highlighting JSX elements in JSX
and TSX files in `extended_mode`.
Only the tag names and angle brackets are highlighted. Props retain their usual
highlighting, which makes them easier to read.
